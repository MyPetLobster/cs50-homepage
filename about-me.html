        <p id="abt-para">I'm a property manager/handyman/carpenter/painter living in Maine. I recently decided to dedicate my free time to learning how to program. 
           I've always been happiest when I have a creative outlet. I had hoped that by working for myself I would eventually find a way to carve out 
           free time to make music or write or draw. But the truth is that the work just never ends. So, new plan! I'm going to put all my effort into
           learning to code. At this point I don't know if I'm interested in front-end, back-end, software, security, etc. It's all so new and exciting.
           I plan to keep this page updated throughout my journey.
